Audit
The audit, balance, and control layer is the area from which you can observe what is currently running
within your data science environment. It records
• Process-execution statistics
• Balancing and controls
• Rejects and error-handling
• Codes management
An audit is a systematic and independent examination of the ecosystem.
The audit sublayer records the processes that are running at any specific point within the environment.
This information is used by data scientists and engineers to understand and plan future improvements
to the processing.
